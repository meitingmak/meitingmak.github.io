      Dissertation title: "Advancing the Theory of Haze in Exoplanetary Atmospheres" ~
      I led the development and application of multiple haze parameterisations within a 3D General Circulation Model, the UK Met Office Unified Model, to study how hazes would impact the habitability of our Early Earth and TRAPPIST-1e, and how hazes change the transmission spectra of differnt hot-Jupiters.
