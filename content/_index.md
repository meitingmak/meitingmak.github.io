        My main interest lies in understanding how photochemical hazes can impact the atmospheric structure among different types of planets, and how these effects, in turn, shape their habitability and observability. Currently, I am investigating how atmospheric transport processes lead to asymmetrical haze distributions across a planet’s atmosphere, and how these variations can be detected with state-of-the-art telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope.
